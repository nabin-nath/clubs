        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Objective:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          Generally, appliances used in our home are controlled with the help of switches. We aim to design a home
          automation system which will be based on DTMF technology. Not only one can control home appliances from
          anywhere, but it also reduces waste of electricity. It is very low cost compared to other technologies like
          GSM.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Abstract:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          Whatever appliances we are dealing with, in our daily life, we want to control them without physically moving
          to the control unit. We use many different types of communication in control applications to control home
          appliances, industrial appliances, and other types of automation. There are two types of communication that
          we generally use - one is wired and other one is wireless. In wireless communication we transmit signal
          wirelessly, like using radio frequency (RF) and in wired communication we use wires like copper wire.
          In this project “DTMF Based Home Automation System” we are going to control our home appliances
          wirelessly.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Execution:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          • DTMF encoder and decoder is designed.<br>
          • DTMF codes will be used to give ON/OFF
          input to different devices using relay module.<br>
          • Multiple devices can also be operated
          with one single signal input.
        </p>

          <i class="text-white my-12">Home Automation</i><br>
          In this project we aim to automate home tasks with the help of DTMF technology like We can turn off lights and
          switch anything from anywhere. Through this technology, you can manipulate your household gadgets like
          lights, fans, TV, etc. by sitting in any corner of the house or any other place irrespective of distance. So,
          to make
          it possible home automation technology is introduced, where we can automate our home easily with the help of
          DTMF technology. This can also help in saving electricity and you can monitor all your gadgets. <br><br>
          <i class="text-white my-12">Automatic Door Lock System</i><br>
          This project is aimed to design a security locking system by using DTMF technology. This system comprises
          of a micro controller based digital lock presented, here is an access control system that allows only
          authorized
          persons to access a restricted area. This system is best suitable for corporate offices, ATMs, and home
          security.
          The main idea is to provide security to homes and offices by implementing security system for doors using
          microcontroller.
