        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Objective:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          The aim is to create an interactive virtual environment for the exhibition of various hardware projects by
          creating their 3D models and interaction with a question answering bot.

        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">About This Project:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          Due to the pandemic situation conducting an exhibition was a tedious task. To get through this problem we have
          created a project namely E-Exhibition. This project consists of a virtual environment with 3D models of
          numerous projects which solves the problem of conducting exhibitions virtually. The sole reason for developing
          this project is to showcase many other projects made with excruciating efforts by creating their 3D Models so
          that it can be seen anywhere by anyone.

        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Technical points:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          The project has been made by using open-source softwares like Blender, Unity and Vs Code which contributes to
          its zero cost. Blender has been used to create 3D models of projects. Then the environment of the exhibition
          hall in Unity. Also the projects involve use of Natural Language Processing for creating an interactive bot to
          resolve the queries.



        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Techstack: </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          1. Augmented Reality<br>
          2. Natural language processing<br>
          3. Cloud Technology<br>



        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Execution:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          We have made an app where we have added a question answering bot to the project that'll answer the user's
          queries
          regarding the project and their 3D models of those projects. In this app we can see buttons for different
          projects and by clicking on them it will lead the user to that project environment where we can see the model
          of the project and its details.

        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Software Used:
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          Blender - It is used for 3D objects and virtual element creations and the models used in the project.
          Unity - It is used for creating the virtual environment and graphic animations.
          VS code - As all the codes are done in python and C# and VS code is used for programming.


        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Benefits:
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          The project is made upon zero cost. Also it can be used as an art exhibition. The project also saves money,
          space and
          time by creating a virtual environment. Due to the pandemic it is difficult to examine the hardware projects
          by viewing them in videos and images and with this we can see the 3D model of the projects and their workings.
